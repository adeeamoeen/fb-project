Welcome to the Firebase Grocery Store Web Application! This project is the culmination of my journey as a beginner, where I've delved into the world of web development using Firebase. The aim of this application is to simulate a grocery store experience, offering features like user authentication, product browsing, cart management, and more.




#Key Features
User Authentication: Implement user sign-in and sign-up functionality using Firebase Authentication. Users can have different roles: regular users and admin.

Home Page: A user-friendly homepage where customers can explore a variety of grocery items available for purchase.

Cart Management: Allow users to add items to their cart, view their cart contents, and proceed to checkout.

Admin Dashboard: An admin-specific section for managing product inventory and settings.

#Technologies Used
Firebase Authentication: Secure user authentication and role management.
Firebase Realtime Database: Store and manage product information, user data, and cart contents.
Firebase Storage: Upload and store product images.
HTML, CSS, JavaScript: Build the front-end interface and user interactions.
[Other technologies, libraries, or frameworks used]
